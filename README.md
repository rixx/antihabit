Antihabits is a website that shuffles a list. [Reasons here](https://ramble.rixx.de/2020/03/07/antihabits.html), online
version [here](https://antihabits.rixx.de/).

Other than that, you can create either daily tasks or one-off tasks, which will disappear once the day is over.  You can
shuffle your agenda repeatedly, and the current order will be saved in your browser. You can mark tasks as done for the
day â€“ and that's it.
